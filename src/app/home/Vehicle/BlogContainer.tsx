      <h1 className='blog title'>Here are the things you should buy used</h1>
      <p className="text_bold">Sports and outdoor equipment, children's gadgets and technology are some examples of things that can be found in top condition but at bargain prices on the used market. Here we list some things you should buy used instead of new.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to being good for the environment, it is economical to buy used. Sporting goods , outdoor equipment and children's items that have only been used for a single season or a few times often end up on Blocket for well below the purchase price.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some things you should always check if you find Blocket before buying new.</p>
    <h4>1. Outdoor equipment</h4>
    <p>A new tent that can withstand the elements often costs over SEK 10,000 new. At the same time, it is something that can maintain high quality even after a few years of use. The same applies to backpacks, storm kitchens, camping tables, binoculars and other equipment . Here you can bargain and find quality products for as little as a third of the new price.
    </p>
    <h4>2. Baby clothes</h4>
    <p>Small babies quickly outgrow their clothes and before they start crawling, they don't do anything that directly tears their clothes. Therefore, there is a plethora of baby clothes for sale on various second-hand sites. Another advantage of buying baby clothes second hand is that they have probably already been washed a number of times. Small babies' skin can be very sensitive and if you buy new clothes, you should wash the clothes at least a couple of times before using them.

    <h4>3. Electronics</h4>
    <p>Do you need a new computer , TV or smartphone ? Here you can save thousands by checking the second-hand trade first. There are plenty of tech geeks who want the latest model and therefore sell their technology even though it is (in the eyes of many) basically new and still high performance. <br /> Do you know which model you want? Create alerts here on Blocket and be quick when a nice copy appears.

    <h4>4. Furniture and furnishings</h4>
    <p>Many people think that used furniture is only for a certain type of interior design, but it is of course possible to find newer furniture second hand. At Blocket, everything from valuable design classics to IKEA's latest collections can be found at lower prices. <br />All ads within furniture and home furnishings https://www.blocket.se/annonser/stockholm/for_hemmet/mobler_heminredning?cg=2040&r=11&sort=date</p>
    <h4>5. Sports equipment</h4>
    <p>Skis , bicycles , climbing equipment and surfboards - the list can be made long of sports equipment that has been left in storage unused and then sold. Keep an eye out especially when the stores are cleared in the spring or when things are not in season, then you can make the best bargains.</p>
    <h4>6. Tools and machines</h4>
    <p>By buying used tools and machines, you can afford more high-quality products without paying more. But be careful when buying machines that are battery powered. The batteries may have gone bad and new ones may be expensive. Many manufacturers have batteries that are compatible with all their machines, so if you already have a machine with a good battery, you can use it for several machines from the same manufacturer.</p>
